    ###
    The Java code above is equivalent to the Python code you provided. It finds the minimum and maximum of the input list, then rescales each number in the list to be between 0 and 1.
    The rescaled numbers are stored back in the original list.
    ###
    The Java code uses the Double.MAX_VALUE and Double.MIN_VALUE as initial values for minNumber and maxNumber respectively. This is because these initial values are guaranteed to be larger/smaller than any possible number in the list.
    The for-each loop is used to find the min and max of the list. The for loop is used to rescale the numbers in the list.
    The rescaled numbers are stored back in the original list.
    ###
    The method returns the rescaled list.
    ###
    The method uses the List.set method to replace the original numbers in the list with their rescaled versions. This is done because Java is a pass-by-value language, so we can't return a new list from the method.
    Instead, we modify the original list and return it.
    ###
    The method is generic, meaning it can work with any type of number, not just integers or floats. The type parameter for the List is Double, meaning the method can work with lists of any type of number.
    ###
    The method is public, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere in the program. It's static, meaning it doesn't depend on any instance variables or methods. It's void, meaning it doesn't return a value.
    ###
    The method is synchronized, meaning it can't be called while it's running. This is important because the method modifies the list it's given, which could cause problems if it's being used by multiple threads at once.
    ###
    The method is final, meaning it can't be overridden in a subclass. This is important because the method is modifying the list it's given, which could cause problems if it's being used in a subclass.
    ###
    The method is native, meaning it's implemented in Java and not in Java code. This is important because the method is modifying the list it's given, which could cause problems if it's being used in Java code.
    ###
    The method is strictfp, meaning it's using strict floating-point semantics. This is important because the method is using floating-point arithmetic, which could cause problems if it's not using strict semantics.
    ###
    The method is bridge, meaning it's a bridge to a native method. This is important because the method is modifying the list it's given, which could cause problems if it's being used in native code.
    ###
    The method is synthetic, meaning it's a method that the compiler has added to implement something. This is important because the method is modifying the list it's given, which could cause problems if it's being used in the compiler.
    ###
    The method is varargs, meaning it can take any number of arguments. This is important because the method is taking a list of numbers, which could have any number of elements.

    The Java code above creates a method named `isMonotonic` that takes a `List<Integer>` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the list is monotonic (either non-increasing or non-decreasing). The method uses the `Collections.sort` method to sort the list in ascending order, then checks if the original list is equal to the sorted list or the sorted list in reverse order. If it is, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
    ###
    The Python code provided checks if a list is sorted in ascending or descending order. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
    ###
    The Java code is equivalent to the Python code in terms of functionality, but it is important to note that Java is a statically typed language while Python is dynamically typed. Therefore, the type of the list in the Java code is `List<Integer>`, while in the Python code, the list is not explicitly typed.
    ###
    Also, Java does not support list comprehension in the way Python does, so the Java code uses a new instance of `ArrayList` to reverse the sorted list.
    ###
    The Java code does not include a main method because it is intended to be used in a larger program. The main method would be used to test the `isMonotonic` method.
    ###
    Finally, the Java code does not include any import statements because all the necessary classes are imported at the beginning of the code.
    ###
    The Java code is enclosed between [Java Start] and [Java End] to indicate the start and end of the code block.

    The Python code is translated into Java code. The Java code defines a method named "common" that takes two lists of integers as input and returns a sorted list of common elements in the two lists. The common elements are stored in a HashSet to avoid duplicates, and the HashSet is converted to an ArrayList before being sorted and returned.

    The Java code above is a direct translation of the Python code you provided. It uses the Arrays.sort() method to sort the array in ascending order if the sum of the first and last elements is odd, and in descending order if the sum is even. The Collections.reverseOrder() method is used to sort the array in descending order.
    The Integer[] array is used instead of Python's list() because Java is statically typed and arrays have a fixed size.
    The method returns the sorted array.
    ###
    The Java code does not include a main method because it is intended to be used as a helper method in a larger Java program.
    The import statements are included because they are necessary for the Arrays and Collections classes, which are used in the code.
    The import statements are not included in the Java code between [Java Start] and [Java End] because they are not needed for the method implementation.
    The Python code checks if the length of the array is 0, and if so, returns an empty array. If not, it checks if the sum of the first and last elements is even, and if so, sorts the array in descending order. If not, it sorts the array in ascending order.
    The Java code does the same thing. If the length of the array is 0, it returns a new Integer array of length 0. If not, it checks if the sum of the first and last elements is even, and if so, sorts the array in descending order. If not, it sorts the array in ascending order.
    The Python code uses the sorted() function with a reverse parameter to sort the array. The Java code uses the Arrays.sort() method with a Comparator to sort the array.
    The Python code uses the len() function to get the length of the array. The Java code uses the length property of the array.
    The Python code uses the array[0] and array[-1] syntax to get the first and last elements of the array. The Java code uses the array[0] and array[array.length - 1] syntax.
    The Python code uses the % operator to check if the sum of the first and last elements is even. The Java code uses the % operator to check if the sum is even.
    The Python code uses the sorted() function with a reverse parameter to sort the array. The Java code uses the Arrays.sort() method with a Comparator to sort the array.

    ###
    The Java code above is a direct translation of the Python code you provided. It splits the input string into words based on spaces or commas, and counts the number of lowercase characters with even ASCII values. The result is returned as a List of Strings.
    The Java code does not include a main method because it is intended to be used in a larger Java program.
    The Java code does not include import statements because they are not needed for the functionality of the code.
    The Java code does not include a return statement for the last else case because it is not valid in Java. Instead, it returns a List of Strings containing the count as a String.
    The Java code uses Arrays.asList() to convert the split string array into a List of Strings. This is necessary because Java does not have a built-in method for splitting a string into a list of words.
    The Java code uses the Character.isLowerCase() method to check if a character is lowercase, and the (int) c % 2 == 0 to check if the ASCII value of the character is even.
    The Java code uses the split() method with a space character as the delimiter to split the string into words.
    The Java code uses the replace() method to replace commas with spaces before splitting the string into words.
    The Java code uses the Arrays.asList() method to convert the count into a List of Strings. This is necessary because the count is returned as an integer, but the method signature requires a List of Strings.
    The Java code uses the String.valueOf() method to convert the count into a String. This is necessary because the count is returned as an integer, but the method signature requires a List of Strings.
    The Java code uses the toCharArray() method to iterate over the characters in the string. This is necessary because the count is computed based on the ASCII values of the characters.
