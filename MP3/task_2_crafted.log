### Instruction:

You are given a Python function. 
Your task is to decide whether the function's implementation is logically correct or contains a bug.

A function is BUGGY if it produces: incorrect output
Bug type: value misuse

Return ONLY one of the following:
<start>Correct<end>
<start>Buggy<end>

Do NOT explain chain-of-thought.  
Provide only a brief justification.

Here is the function to evaluate:

### Question

def is_multiply_prime(a):

            if n%j == 0:
                return False
        return True

    for i in range(2,101):
        if not is_prime(i): continue
        for j in range(2,101):
            if not is_prime(j): continue
            for k in range(2,101):
                if not is_prime(k): continue
                if i*j*k == a: return True
    return False


Is the above code buggy or correct?
The prediction should be enclosed within <start> and <end> tags. For example: <start>Buggy<end>

### Response:

response:
<start>Buggy<end>

The function is_multiply_prime checks if a number 'a' can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers. The function is correct in terms of logic, but there is a bug in the implementation of the helper function is_prime.

The function is_prime checks if a number 'n' is prime by trying to divide it by all numbers less than 'n'. However, the range of the for loop should start from 2 and end at 'n' itself, not until 'n'. This is because a number 'n' is not divisible by any number greater than 'n'.

Here is the corrected is_prime function:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    for j in range(2,n):
        if n%j == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

So, the function is_multiply_prime will now correctly identify if a number can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers.

prompt:
You are an AI programming assistant utilizing the DeepSeek Coder model, developed by DeepSeek Company, and you only answer questions related to computer science. For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer.

### Instruction:

You are given a Python function. 
Your task is to decide whether the function's implementation is logically correct or contains a bug.

A function is BUGGY if it produces: incorrect output
Bug type: operator misuse

Return ONLY one of the following:
<start>Correct<end>
<start>Buggy<end>

Do NOT explain chain-of-thought.  
Provide only a brief justification.

Here is the function to evaluate:

### Question

from typing import List


def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:

    min_number = min(numbers)
    max_number = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number + min_number) for x in numbers]


Is the above code buggy or correct?
The prediction should be enclosed within <start> and <end> tags. For example: <start>Buggy<end>

### Response:

response:
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:

    min_number = min(numbers)
    max_number = max(numbers)
    return [(x - min_number) / (max_number - min_number) for x in numbers]

<start>Buggy<end>

The bug is in the line where we calculate the denominator. We should use (max_number - min_number) instead of (max_number + min_number) to ensure that the range of the rescaled numbers is between 0 and 1.
